          <span className="previous-career-first-letter">C</span>urrently, I am the Founder and Owner of Valence LLC.
          My knack for languages led me to take multiple language courses in college: 3 years of Spanish, 1 year of Japanese, and 1 year of American Sign Language.
          In 2017, I began working with The Literacy and Language Center, LLC., a well-known private clinic that provided remedial-grade services, before graduating
          with a BA in Communicative Disorders and Minor in Special Education in 2018.

          {/* Paragraph 2 */}
          <span className="previous-career-first-letter">W</span>hile applying my academic skills and knowledge to the beginning of my career of working with students
          with academic delays from low-income households, I'd strongly and passionately argue that I have done some of the most fulfilling work I will ever do in my life.

          <span className="previous-career-first-letter">2</span> years, 2 promotions, and 4 job titles later, the clinic had to unfortunately close their doors.
          I saw an opportunity and decided to start a business continuing the amazing work I had been doing. In April 2019, Valence LLC was formed and has been
          going strong well into the pandemic. This year marks the 3-year anniversary of Valence's launch.
