After nearly a decade in education, program management, and business operations, I made a full switch to tech in 2024 with Genentech. There I launched and landed a GMP-compliant workflow-guided application that continues to be rolled out and expanded throughout the South San Francisco site to this day.",

        "1": "Previously, I was the Founder, Owner, and Head Learning Specialist of Valence. My knack for linguistics led me to pursue a career in Speech Pathology. In 2017, I began working with The Literacy and Language Center (LLC), a well-known clinic based in San Francisco that provided remedial-grade educational services, before graduating with a B.A in Communicative Disorders and Minor in Special Education in 2018.",
        "2": "The LLC would unfortunately close their doors, but another would open for me: Valence. I, like many of my colleagues, believed in the program and services we offered to families, so I continued the legacy of the LLC for another 5 years before making a full switch to tech.",
